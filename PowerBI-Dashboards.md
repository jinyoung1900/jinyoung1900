One of the earliest models I made. Displays corporate financial report for a fictional company from 2014 to 2015 in PowerBI.

Itâ€™s useful for quickly spotting whatâ€™s selling well, where sales are happening, and how the business is performing over time.

It also contains a light written analyis on the bottom left that writes what the data is showing and why it is.

#### ðŸ”· Project 2: Steam Game Analysis  

![SteamPowerBI project](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c637ecd8-a8f8-4486-9c68-eea5943b563c)

More of a personal project than the previous one, from data cleaning to dashboard creation. Used steam game data that went up until 2019 before change in Steam privacy policy. 

EngagementÂ Score = ( averageÂ playtimeÂ (minutes) / 60 )Ã— estimatedÂ owners

Aim of this was to mainly see if there was any corelation with engagement and other aspects such as release number or genre, but to also to give general information such as revenue by genre. 

What I found more interesting is to figure out best price by genre by comparing it with like ration (Likes and displikes).
