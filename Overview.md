> At first, Discord was just a space for reporting game bugs and occasional core fan talks. However, we turned it into a dev feedback engine where we pushed updates based on community contests and votes.

  Built and expanded the community from around 200 to over 1,000 members during the launch window. This became a key source of qualitative insight and player retention.

- **📱 Multi-Platform Presence**  
  Managed and moderated communities on Steam, Reddit, and Discord. Maintained transparency, delivered fast support, and shaped a tone that players respected.

- **🔄 Feedback Loops**  
  Established a system to capture community suggestions, critical bugs, and feed them to the development team in actionable formats. Bonus content was also created based on community contests.

- **💬 Community Creation Consulting**  
  Consulted several new game communities and developers when launching their own Discord. From basic mindset to bot installation and custom templates.
