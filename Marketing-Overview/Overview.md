> At first, Discord was just a space for reporting game bugs and occasional core fan talks. However, we turned it into a dev feedback engine where we pushed updates based on community contests and votes. As I gained more experience and time went on, knowing more about the consumers naturally made me move onto platform management, ads management, and content creation for higher RoI.

  Built and expanded the community from around 200 to over 1,000 members during the launch window. This became a key source of qualitative insight and player retention.

  Managed and moderated communities on Steam, Reddit, and Discord. Maintained transparency, delivered fast support, and shaped a tone that players respected.

  Consulted several new game communities and developers when launching their own Discord. From basic mindset to bot installation and custom templates.

- **🧰 Platform Experience**  
  Versed in Steamworks, Meta Horizon (formerly Oculus Developer Hub), and PlayStation Partners platforms. Experience managing game listings, publishing workflows, AB testing, and platform specific marketing materials.e

- **🎯 Paid Advertising Campaigns**
