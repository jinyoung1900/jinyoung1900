One of the earliest models I made. Displays corporate financial report for a fictional company from 2014 to 2015 in PowerBI.

It’s useful for quickly spotting what’s selling well, where sales are happening, and how the business is performing over time.

It also contains a light written analyis on the bottom left that writes what the data is showing and why it is.

#### 🔷 Project 2: Steam Game Analysis  

![steam](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e61e6cfd-8b37-4ec6-b759-652b9af27403)


More of a personal project than the previous one, from data cleaning to dashboard creation. Used steam game data that went up until 2019 before change in Steam privacy policy. 

Engagement Score = ( average playtime (minutes) / 60 )× estimated owners

Aim of this was to mainly see if there was any corelation with engagement and other aspects such as release number or genre, but to also to give general information such as revenue by genre. 

What I found more interesting is to figure out best price by genre by comparing it with like ration (Likes and displikes).

#### 🔷 Project 3: Data Visualisation course

Quick one day project I did for Data Visaulisation course by Juuso Koponen

Tried to visualise the popularity of games from 2000 to 2010 by sales and critic rating. 

The point of this 2 day intense seminar was to learn about advanced visualisation methods, color grade, and theory behind using correct visualisation. 

In here, by using pastel color and removing values, it helps to easily visualise contents without being distracting.  

Bump chart, or wave chart since PwBI doesn't have one, were used in time vs sale price by genre. Bump chart was specifically developed from NYtimes to rate genres of movies that came out in specific year. 

To summarise, it's good to 1) Draw a draft of visualsiation, 2) Prototype with apps such as RAW, and 3) Finish it using solution that is fitting. e.g. using Mapbox for map related infographics.
